			<h1>Hi! I'm Qingyuan.</h1>

            <h2>I’m a first year ECE Master's student at the University of Michigan specializing in Software Engineer. My background, however, was in Power Engineering.</h2> 
            <p>I completed my undergrad at The University of Shanghai for Science and Technology(USST) in 2018 with a major in <b>Electrical Engineering and Automation</b>. After graduated from USST, I studied at Duke University for Computer Engineering and received Duke ECE merited scholarship. At Duke University, I began my career as a software developer.Since the programming ability and the understanding of the computer architecture become increasingly important, I took the courses programming data structure algorithm in C++, Theory/Practice of algorithms, fundamental computer system and engineering.After one semester study, I found myself still have a lot to improve and I never give up. I believe I need to put what I learned from class into practice in order to be a solid software engineer. Therefore, I took 4 months to study the full stack knowledge and built an online shopping website by using these knowledge.</p>
            <br>
			<p>In last semester, I took some courses from UMSI and did some interesting web crawling and scraping projects. One of the projects is to query the hashtag like “#2020election” using Twitter standard search API. The result is finding out the hashtag and key-words that most commonly co-occurs with that tag and predicting the trend. I find it fascinating how important the role big data plays in today’s world. Although I do not have much experience in this area, I can see such method being applied in many different events and industries. For example, I have always had questions such as: how does the popularity and discussion of an upcoming movie on social media platforms influence the actual box office? Is there only positive correlation or it could be the other way around? How to predict box office basing on the “buzz” a movie creates? What are the benefits of new big data measures incorporating social media and online searches over traditional forecasting metrics? These could be answered by big data measures as there are so many insights that can be drawn from such large pool of data points and eventually connected into lines to improve the efficiency of future work and even the operation of human society. The future application of big data excites me and drives to pursue a degree for Data Science.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I'm also interested in the front-end engineer work, since I love beautiful things and I enjoy creating beautiful webpage, I will have a sense of satisfaction when I see the website that I built.
            Last year, I took the course SI539 Complex Website Design. I Build a website which introduce the wield animals around the world by using HTML, CSS and Javascript. And I use the OpenWeather API to retrieve the weather location about a city. From these kind of exiperience I become a patient and positive person.
